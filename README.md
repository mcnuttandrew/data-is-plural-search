# Data is Plural Search

A simple elm app for browsing the [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) data newsletter in a web based format, rather than a spreadsheet. This project is made with big appreciation and respect for [Jeremy Singer-Vine](https://twitter.com/jsvine)'s project. This work bares no affiliation with that one, again, other than admiration.
